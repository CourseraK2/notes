Why does a liver cell divide into a liver cell? \\
Epigenetics. For eg.DNA ,ethylation silences gene expression and this is kind of an 'in-memory' process. The methylated sites are inherited too.

DNA Methylation: \\
Methyl group gets added to C/A. Affects gene expression when cells divide and differentiate.
Some Methylation is irreversible and 'heritable'. This is generally reset during zygote formation.

Reason it should happen is to prevent expression of foreign genes that might have entered the host.
this is also essential from the point of view of X-chromosome inactivation. Usually associated with a CpG 
context.

Unmethlated CpGs are clustered as CpG islands(200 bp of contiguous CpG occurence generally at the start of a gene) present in 5' 
translated regions. In cases like cancer these sites are hypermethylated that leads to gene silencing being inherited by daughter cells.

Methylated sites are affected becuase:\\
1. They  affect transcriptional protein binding \\
2. methyl-cpG-binding proteins may be bind to methydlated sites These modify histones leading to inactive chromatic(heterochromatin)
